# Compare performance of raw references with smart pointers

The benchmark results for both non-optimized and optimized builds are quite interesting. Let's break them down and analyze them.

### Non-Optimized Build (Debug Build):

| Benchmark                   | Time (ns) | CPU (ns) | Iterations |
| --------------------------- | --------- | -------- | ---------- |
| BM_ReferencesCalculation    | 1398317   | 1398201  | 501        |
| BM_SmartPointersCalculation | 3329676   | 3329351  | 207        |

### Optimized Build (Release Build):

| Benchmark                   | Time (ns) | CPU (ns) | Iterations |
| --------------------------- | --------- | -------- | ---------- |
| BM_ReferencesCalculation    | 618017    | 617970   | 1044       |
| BM_SmartPointersCalculation | 652545    | 652358   | 1061       |

### Key Observations:

1. **Performance Improvement from Debug to Optimized Build**:

   - **References Calculation**: The time improved from ~1,398,317 ns to ~618,017 ns (about **2.26x** faster).
   - **Smart Pointers Calculation**: The time improved from ~3,329,676 ns to ~652,545 ns (about **5.1x** faster).

   This indicates that optimizations made a **significant difference**, particularly for the smart pointer version, which had more overhead in the non-optimized build. The smart pointer version saw a much larger speedup due to optimizations because the compiler can better optimize away some of the smart pointer management overhead in the release build.

2. **Reference-Based vs. Smart Pointer-Based Performance in Optimized Build**:

   - **Non-Optimized Build**: In the non-optimized build, the reference-based solution was about **2.38x** faster than the smart pointer-based solution.
   - **Optimized Build**: In the optimized build, the difference between the two is **minimal**. The reference-based solution is only slightly faster than the smart pointer-based solution (~618,017 ns vs. ~652,545 ns).

   This suggests that in optimized builds, the overhead of `std::shared_ptr` is reduced significantly by the compiler's optimization strategies, such as inlining, better memory management, and reference counting optimizations. The performance difference between references and smart pointers becomes **much smaller** in the optimized build.

3. **Close Iteration Count in Optimized Build**:

   - **References**: 1,044 iterations
   - **Smart Pointers**: 1,061 iterations

   The number of iterations is very close in the optimized build, meaning that Google Benchmark ran the test cases for almost the same amount of real time for both. This reflects that the performance of both solutions is almost comparable in an optimized environment.

### Interpretation of Results:

1. **Non-Optimized Build**:

   - The smart pointer solution has much higher overhead, likely due to the additional cost of managing reference counting, heap allocations, and pointer dereferencing in debug mode.
   - The reference-based solution, being simpler with no dynamic memory management, performed better as expected.

2. **Optimized Build**:
   - The performance gap narrows significantly after optimizations. The compiler is able to optimize away much of the overhead of `std::shared_ptr`, resulting in the two approaches having similar performance.
   - Despite the heavy memory management required by smart pointers, the optimizations make them almost as fast as raw references, demonstrating how modern compilers can optimize even complex features like smart pointers.

### Takeaways:

- **In Debug Builds**: The reference-based solution is significantly faster due to the absence of smart pointer overhead. This is expected in a non-optimized environment, where the compiler doesn't attempt to eliminate overhead from constructs like `std::shared_ptr`.
- **In Optimized Builds**: The smart pointer-based solution performs nearly as well as the reference-based one. This suggests that in release or production scenarios, the overhead of smart pointers is mostly optimized away, making them a viable option without substantial performance loss, despite their safety and convenience.

### Next Steps:

- If performance is **critical** and your code is running in a **highly optimized environment**, both solutions are close enough that you can choose either based on your needs. The small difference (~5% in favor of references) might not be enough to justify avoiding smart pointers if safety and maintainability are important.
- If you're working in a **debug environment** or **tight performance constraints**, the reference-based approach would be preferable, as it avoids the overhead introduced by smart pointers.

These results give you confidence that in optimized builds, smart pointers are quite efficient, though references will always be the fastest due to the absence of any overhead.

##

In real-life scenarios, especially in game development and other performance-critical applications, the choice between **raw references** and **smart pointers** (such as `std::shared_ptr` and `std::unique_ptr`) is based on balancing **performance**, **safety**, and **memory management**. Both solutions have their own strengths and weaknesses, and experienced C++ engineers typically weigh these factors when deciding which to use.

Here’s a detailed look at how the two approaches are viewed in real-world applications like game development:

### 1. **Performance Considerations**:

- **Raw References and Pointers**:

  - **Pros**: Raw references and pointers are the fastest option because they introduce **zero overhead** in terms of memory management. In performance-critical parts of a game engine (e.g., the rendering loop, physics calculations), avoiding overhead is crucial.
  - **Cons**: However, raw pointers and references provide **no built-in safety**. Developers need to manually ensure that objects are not dereferenced after they’ve been deleted or moved. Mistakes here can lead to **use-after-free** errors, memory corruption, and crashes.

- **Smart Pointers**:
  - **Pros**: `std::shared_ptr` and `std::unique_ptr` bring **automatic memory management**, reducing the chance of memory leaks or dangling pointers. They provide **safe ownership semantics**: `std::unique_ptr` guarantees exclusive ownership, and `std::shared_ptr` ensures multiple owners can safely share a resource.
  - **Cons**: In highly optimized loops, the overhead of reference counting (`std::shared_ptr`) or heap allocation (`std::unique_ptr`) can be noticeable, particularly in **hot paths** (code that runs frequently and must be extremely fast). However, in many cases, **optimized builds** mitigate these overheads effectively, as seen in your benchmark results.

### 2. **Real-Life Scenarios in Game Development**:

- **Low-Level Systems (Engine Core, Graphics, Physics)**:

  - **Preferred Solution**: Here, **raw pointers and references** are often preferred, especially when performance is absolutely critical (e.g., in the rendering pipeline, physics simulations, or AI calculations).
  - **Why**: These systems often need to avoid the overhead of dynamic memory allocation or reference counting. In these low-level systems, developers manage the object lifetimes themselves (e.g., via object pools or custom allocators) to minimize performance costs.

- **Higher-Level Systems (Gameplay, UI, Scripting)**:
  - **Preferred Solution**: **Smart pointers** (`std::shared_ptr`, `std::unique_ptr`) are more common in higher-level systems where safety is a priority, and performance is not as critical as in core engine systems.
  - **Why**: Gameplay objects often have complex ownership semantics (e.g., a player object might be referenced by several game systems). Using `std::shared_ptr` ensures that memory is automatically managed, reducing the risk of dangling pointers or leaks. This is particularly important in large codebases where maintaining strict ownership manually can become error-prone.

### 3. **What Experienced C++ Engineers Say**:

- **Raw Pointers/References in Performance-Critical Code**:

  - Engineers working on game engines (e.g., Unreal Engine, custom engines) often favor **raw pointers** and references in the innermost loops where every millisecond counts. The primary reason is the **zero overhead** and full control over memory usage, which is crucial in optimizing every bit of performance.
  - Examples of such engineers might point out that in critical areas, managing memory manually and avoiding the overhead of `std::shared_ptr`'s reference counting is necessary for achieving **real-time performance**.

- **Smart Pointers for Safety and Manageability**:
  - Many C++ engineers advocate for using **smart pointers** (especially `std::unique_ptr` for exclusive ownership and `std::shared_ptr` for shared ownership) in codebases where maintainability and safety are paramount.
  - The rationale is that for large-scale projects, avoiding memory leaks and ensuring proper ownership semantics is worth the minimal performance cost, especially in **non-critical** or less performance-sensitive code paths (such as gameplay logic or asset management systems).
  - C++ experts, such as those involved in standard library development or large-scale software systems, recommend **`std::unique_ptr`** for exclusive ownership as a good trade-off between performance and safety.

### 4. **Best Practices in Game Development**:

- **Prefer `std::unique_ptr`** where ownership semantics are simple:

  - If an object has **one clear owner**, use `std::unique_ptr`. It introduces very little overhead (just heap allocation) and ensures the resource is cleaned up when no longer needed.
  - **Example**: A game object that belongs to a specific scene and is destroyed when the scene is unloaded.

- **Use `std::shared_ptr`** sparingly\*\*:

  - In performance-critical parts of the code, such as real-time rendering or physics, avoid `std::shared_ptr` due to its reference-counting overhead.
  - **Example**: For shared resources like textures or meshes that are used by multiple entities, a custom resource manager or manual memory management might be used to avoid reference counting overhead.

- **Use Raw Pointers for Non-Ownership Relationships**:
  - When a class needs to refer to an object but does **not own** it, raw pointers or references are typically used. This is common in scenarios where **ownership is managed externally** (e.g., in an object pool or a custom allocator).
  - **Example**: A physics component holding a reference to a player object but not owning it. The lifetime of the player is managed elsewhere, so a raw pointer or reference is appropriate.

### Conclusion:

- **Raw Pointers/References**: Preferred in performance-critical, low-level code where you need maximum control over memory and performance is a key concern. However, it requires careful manual management of object lifetimes.
- **Smart Pointers**: Typically used in higher-level systems where **safety and maintainability** outweigh the minor performance cost. In real-life game development, `std::unique_ptr` is often favored for ownership due to its minimal overhead, while `std::shared_ptr` is used cautiously for more complex ownership cases.

### General Rule:

- Use **raw pointers and references** for **performance-critical inner loops**, and use **smart pointers** when **safety and automatic memory management** are more important than micro-optimizations.

Both approaches have their place, and experienced C++ engineers recommend using **the right tool for the right job** depending on the context in which you’re working.
