# Scripting Engine Design Document

## 1. Introduction

This document specifies the design for the Scripting Engine module of our game engine, which is tasked with providing a flexible and powerful environment for game logic and behavior scripting. The engine will support multiple scripting languages, with an initial focus on Lua and Python, offering developers and content creators the ability to script game events, interactions, and behaviors dynamically. Implemented in Rust, the design prioritizes performance, safety, and ease of integration with the rest of the game engine.

## 2. Architecture Overview

The Scripting Engine is composed of several key components designed to handle script execution, integration, and interaction with the game engine:

- **Language Bindings**: Interfaces between the scripting languages (Lua, Python) and the game engine, allowing scripts to access and manipulate game data.
- **Script Execution Environment**: Manages the execution of scripts, including loading, running, and sandboxing.
- **API Exposure**: Exposes game engine functionality to the scripting environment, enabling scripts to interact with game objects, events, and systems.
- **Script Management**: Handles the loading, caching, and unloading of script files and objects.
- **Debugging and Profiling**: Provides tools and interfaces for debugging scripts and profiling their performance.

### 2.1 Core Modules

#### 2.1.1 Language Bindings

- **Lua Binding**: Facilitates communication between Lua scripts and the game engine.
- **Python Binding**: Enables Python scripts to interact with the game engine.

#### 2.1.2 Script Execution Environment

- **Script Loader**: Loads script files into the execution environment.
- **Sandboxing**: Restricts script access to unauthorized system resources for security.
- **Coroutine Management**: Supports asynchronous script execution through coroutines.

#### 2.1.3 API Exposure

- **Game Object API**: Allows scripts to create, modify, and interact with game objects.
- **Event API**: Enables scripts to listen for and dispatch game events.
- **Utility API**: Provides scripts with access to utility functions, such as logging and math operations.

#### 2.1.4 Script Management

- **Script Cache**: Stores loaded scripts for quick execution without recompilation.
- **Hot Reloading**: Supports the dynamic reloading of scripts during runtime for rapid iteration.

#### 2.1.5 Debugging and Profiling

- **Debug Interface**: Offers script debugging capabilities, including breakpoints and variable inspection.
- **Performance Profiler**: Tracks script execution time and resource usage.

## 3. API Overview

The Scripting Engine exposes a Rust-based API that facilitates the integration of scripting functionalities into the game engine. Key functionalities include:

- **Script Execution**: Functions to execute and manage scripts.
- **API Registration**: Methods for exposing game engine functionalities to the scripting environment.
- **Script Management**: Utilities for loading and unloading scripts.

### 3.1 Example API Functions

```rust
// Initializes the scripting engine with specified language support
fn initialize_scripting_engine(languages: Vec<ScriptLanguage>) -> Result<ScriptingEngine, ScriptError>;

// Executes a script file
fn execute_script(file_path: &str) -> Result<(), ScriptError>;

// Registers a game engine function to be exposed to scripts
fn register_function(name: &str, function: fn()) -> Result<(), ScriptError>;

// Loads a script file into the script cache
fn load_script(file_path: &str) -> Result<ScriptHandle, ScriptError>;

// Unloads a script from the script cache
fn unload_script(handle: ScriptHandle) -> Result<(), ScriptError>;
```

## 4. Integration with Other Modules

The Scripting Engine is designed to integrate closely with other core modules of the game engine:

- **Game World Management**: Scripts can create, manipulate, and query game objects and their properties.
- **Event System**: Scripts can subscribe to and emit game events, facilitating complex game logic and interactions.
- **Resource Management**: The engine can request the loading and unloading of game assets through scripts.
- **UI/UX System**: Scripts can dynamically modify the game's UI in response to player actions or game events.

## 5. Best Practices

- **Security**: Implement robust sandboxing to prevent scripts from accessing sensitive system resources.
- **Performance**: Optimize the execution environment and language bindings to minimize the overhead introduced by scripting.
- **Extensibility**: Design the API and script execution environment to be easily extendable with additional scripting languages or functionalities.
- **Debugging and Profiling Support**: Provide comprehensive tools for script debugging and performance profiling to assist in development and optimization.

## 6. Conclusion

This design document lays out a comprehensive plan for the Scripting Engine module of our game engine, detailing its architecture, core components, API, and integration with other engine modules. By following this design, the development team can implement a powerful and flexible scripting environment that enhances the game development process and enables rich, dynamic game experiences.
