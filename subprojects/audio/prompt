# Audio Engine Design Document

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive design for the Audio Engine module of our game engine, detailing its overall structure, core modules, API, and integration points with other engine components. The Audio Engine is dedicated to managing sound playback, 3D audio spatialization, and audio resource management, ensuring high-quality audio experiences across various gaming platforms. Designed with modularity, performance, and ease of use in mind, the Audio Engine will be implemented in Rust for efficiency and safety.

## 2. Architecture Overview

The Audio Engine is divided into several key components, each responsible for a specific aspect of audio processing and management:

- **Sound Playback**: Manages the playback of audio files, including music and sound effects.
- **3D Audio Spatialization**: Simulates how sound behaves in a 3D space, including distance attenuation, panning, and Doppler effect.
- **Audio Resource Management**: Handles the loading, unloading, and organization of audio assets to optimize memory usage and performance.
- **Mixer**: Combines multiple audio streams into a single output stream, managing volume levels, balance, and audio groups.
- **Audio Streaming**: Supports the streaming of audio data from disk or network to minimize memory usage for large audio files.

### 2.1 Core Modules

#### 2.1.1 Sound Playback

- **Sample Playback**: Handles the playback of short, in-memory audio clips.
- **Stream Playback**: Manages the streaming playback of longer audio tracks.

#### 2.1.2 3D Audio Spatialization

- **Listener**: Represents the point of audio perception, usually tied to the player or camera position.
- **Source**: An audio emitter positioned in 3D space, with properties such as volume, pitch, and spatialization effects.

#### 2.1.3 Audio Resource Management

- **Asset Loader**: Loads audio files into memory, supporting various formats.
- **Asset Cache**: Temporarily stores audio assets in memory for quick access.

#### 2.1.4 Mixer

- **Channels**: Separates audio streams into different channels for individual processing.
- **Groups**: Organizes sounds into groups for collective volume control and effects application.

#### 2.1.5 Audio Streaming

- **Buffer Management**: Dynamically loads and unloads parts of audio files to buffer for continuous playback without occupying excessive memory.

## 3. API Overview

The Audio Engine exposes a Rust-based API that allows for efficient and type-safe interaction with the audio subsystem. Key functionalities include:

- **Initialization**: Set up and configure the audio engine.
- **Sound Playback**: Play, pause, stop, and loop sounds.
- **3D Audio Control**: Position audio sources in 3D space and update listener position.
- **Volume Control**: Adjust the volume of individual sounds or entire groups.
- **Resource Management**: Load and unload audio assets.

### 3.1 Example API Functions

```rust
// Initializes the audio engine with default settings
fn initialize_audio_engine() -> Result<AudioEngine, AudioError>;

// Plays a sound from a file
fn play_sound(file_path: &str, loop: bool) -> Result<SoundHandle, AudioError>;

// Positions a sound source in 3D space
fn set_sound_position(handle: SoundHandle, position: Vector3) -> Result<(), AudioError>;

// Sets the listener position and orientation in 3D space
fn set_listener_position(position: Vector3, orientation: Quaternion) -> Result<(), AudioError>;

// Adjusts the volume of a sound or a group of sounds
fn set_volume(handle: SoundHandle, volume: f32) -> Result<(), AudioError>;

// Loads an audio asset into memory
fn load_audio_asset(file_path: &str) -> Result<AudioAssetHandle, AudioError>;

// Unloads an audio asset from memory
fn unload_audio_asset(handle: AudioAssetHandle) -> Result<(), AudioError>;
```

## 4. Integration with Other Modules

The Audio Engine integrates with other core modules of the game engine to provide a seamless audio experience:

- **Resource Management**: Collaborates with the central resource manager to load and manage audio assets efficiently.
- **Game World Management**: Interacts with the game world manager to position audio sources and listeners based on game entities and camera positions.
- **Scripting Engine**: Exposes audio functionalities to the scripting engine, allowing game designers and developers to script audio behavior.
- **UI/UX System**: Works with the UI/UX module to manage audio cues and feedback for user interactions.

## 5. Best Practices

- **Performance Optimization**: Use low-latency audio APIs and efficient data handling to minimize audio playback delay and ensure smooth performance.
- **Memory Management**: Implement smart caching strategies for audio assets to balance memory usage and audio quality.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Abstract platform-specific audio APIs to enable consistent audio playback across different platforms.
- **Extensibility**: Design the API and system architecture to be easily extensible to support new audio formats, effects, and spatialization techniques.

## 6. Conclusion

This design document outlines a comprehensive approach to building the Audio Engine for our game engine, focusing on modularity, performance, and integration. By adhering to the described architecture and best practices, and leveraging the power of Rust, the development team can implement a robust audio subsystem that enhances the gaming experience across various platforms.

Requirements:

As output I want to get separately one Rust source file with complete API interface of this module (structures, traits and methods/functions/interfaces), that this module provides to other modules in Game Engine.

I want to get submodules of "Audio Engine" system in separate sub-directories (each sub-module have its own directory). And each implementation part of submodule to be in separate source file. Basically following encapsulation pattern and best practices.

Use Meson as build system
