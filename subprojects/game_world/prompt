# Game World Management Design Document

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the design for the Game World Management module of our game engine. This module is tasked with managing the game world's structure, entities, and states, facilitating efficient loading, updating, and unloading of game levels, scenes, and objects. The design prioritizes modularity, performance, and flexibility, enabling developers to create rich, dynamic game worlds. The module will be implemented in Rust, leveraging its performance and safety features.

## 2. Architecture Overview

The Game World Management module is divided into several core components to handle various aspects of game world operations:

- **Scene Management**: Manages scenes within the game, including loading, transitioning, and unloading of scene assets.
- **Entity Component System (ECS)**: Organizes game entities and their behaviors through components and systems for efficient updates.
- **Spatial Partitioning**: Implements spatial structures (e.g., quad-trees, octrees) for efficient querying and management of entities in space.
- **Level Streaming**: Supports the loading and unloading of game world chunks or levels on-the-fly to manage memory usage and performance.
- **Persistence**: Handles saving and loading of game states to allow for game progress persistence.

### 2.1 Core Modules

#### 2.1.1 Scene Management

- **Scene Graph**: Represents the hierarchy of objects and entities in a scene.
- **Scene Loader**: Handles asynchronous loading and setup of scenes.

#### 2.1.2 Entity Component System (ECS)

- **Entities**: Unique identifiers for game objects.
- **Components**: Data containers representing various aspects of entities (e.g., position, health).
- **Systems**: Logic that processes entities with specific component combinations.

#### 2.1.3 Spatial Partitioning

- **Spatial Indexes**: Data structures for organizing entities based on their spatial location.
- **Collision Detection**: Utilizes spatial partitioning to efficiently detect collisions between entities.

#### 2.1.4 Level Streaming

- **Stream Manager**: Coordinates the loading and unloading of level segments based on player location or other criteria.
- **Asset Management**: Works closely with the Resource Management module to handle assets for streaming levels.

#### 2.1.5 Persistence

- **Save System**: Serializes game world state into a save file.
- **Load System**: Deserializes save files to restore game world state.

## 3. API Overview

The Game World Management module offers a Rust-based API that enables game developers to interact with and manipulate the game world. Key functionalities include:

- **Scene Operations**: Functions for loading, transitioning between, and unloading scenes.
- **Entity Management**: Methods for creating, querying, and managing entities and their components.
- **Spatial Queries**: Interfaces for performing spatial queries on entities.
- **Persistence**: Utilities for saving and loading game states.

### 3.1 Example API Functions

```rust
// Initializes the game world management system
fn initialize_world_manager() -> Result<WorldManager, WorldError>;

// Loads a scene asynchronously
fn load_scene(scene_name: &str) -> Result<(), WorldError>;

// Creates a new entity with specified components
fn create_entity(components: &[Component]) -> Entity;

// Queries entities within a specified spatial range
fn query_entities_in_range(range: SpatialRange) -> Vec<Entity>;

// Saves the current game state to a file
fn save_game_state(file_path: &str) -> Result<(), WorldError>;

// Loads a game state from a file
fn load_game_state(file_path: &str) -> Result<(), WorldError>;
```

## 4. Integration with Other Modules

The Game World Management module is designed to integrate closely with other core modules of the game engine:

- **Rendering Engine**: Provides information on entities and their components for rendering.
- **Physics Engine**: Interacts with the ECS for physics simulations and collision detection.
- **Scripting Engine**: Allows for scripting of entity behaviors and game logic.
- **Resource Management**: Manages assets needed for scene construction and level streaming.
- **UI/UX System**: Coordinates with scene transitions and in-game UI related to game world states.

## 5. Best Practices

- **Efficiency in Updates**: Utilize the ECS for efficient updating of entities based on their components.
- **Memory Management**: Implement level streaming and spatial partitioning to optimize memory usage and performance.
- **Flexibility**: Design the module to be flexible, allowing developers to define custom components and systems.
- **Scalability**: Ensure the system can scale to support large, complex game worlds.

## 6. Conclusion

This design document provides a comprehensive framework for developing the Game World Management module for our game engine. By following the outlined architecture, API design, and integration strategies, and adhering to best practices, this module will enable the creation and management of dynamic and complex game worlds, enhancing the gaming experience.

Requirements:

- As output I want to get separately one Rust source file with complete API interface of this module (structures, traits and methods/functions/interfaces), that this module provides to other modules in Game Engine.

- I want to get submodules of "Game World Management" system in separate sub-directories (each sub-module have its own directory). And each implementation part of submodule to be in separate source file. Basically following encapsulation pattern and best practices.

- Use Meson as build system
