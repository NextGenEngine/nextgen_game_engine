# Networking Module Design Document

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the design for the Networking module of our game engine. This module is responsible for enabling multiplayer functionality, handling network communications, synchronizing game states across different devices, and providing tools for both client-server and peer-to-peer architectures. Implemented in Rust, the design emphasizes performance, reliability, security, and ease of use.

## 2. Architecture Overview

The Networking module is divided into several key components to manage different aspects of network communication in games:

- **Connection Management**: Establishes and manages network connections between clients and servers or among peers.
- **Data Serialization/Deserialization**: Converts game data to/from a network-compatible format for transmission.
- **Network Event Handling**: Processes and responds to network events and messages.
- **State Synchronization**: Ensures game state is consistently synchronized across all connected clients.
- **Lobby and Matchmaking**: Manages game sessions, including player matchmaking and lobby management.

### 2.1 Core Modules

#### 2.1.1 Connection Management

- **Client-Server Model**: Supports connecting multiple clients to a central server.
- **Peer-to-Peer Model**: Allows direct connections between clients without a central server.
- **Connection Lifecycle**: Manages the creation, maintenance, and teardown of network connections.

#### 2.1.2 Data Serialization/Deserialization

- **Binary Serialization**: Converts game data into a compact, efficient binary format for transmission.
- **JSON/XML Serialization**: Offers human-readable serialization options for debugging or less performance-critical applications.

#### 2.1.3 Network Event Handling

- **Message Queue**: Collects incoming network messages for processing.
- **Event Dispatcher**: Dispatches network events to the appropriate handlers within the game engine.

#### 2.1.4 State Synchronization

- **State Diffing**: Identifies changes in game state to minimize the amount of data sent over the network.
- **Interpolation and Prediction**: Reduces the perceived latency of networked actions through client-side prediction and interpolation.

#### 2.1.5 Lobby and Matchmaking

- **Lobby Management**: Creates and manages lobbies for players to join before starting a game.
- **Matchmaking System**: Matches players with similar skill levels or preferences into game sessions.

## 3. API Overview

The Networking module exposes a Rust-based API that enables game developers to implement multiplayer functionalities in their games. Key functionalities include:

- **Initializing the Network**: Setup and configuration of the networking system.
- **Connection Management**: Methods for opening, maintaining, and closing connections.
- **Data Transmission**: Functions for sending and receiving game data.
- **Lobby and Matchmaking**: Interfaces for creating lobbies and matchmaking.

### 3.1 Example API Functions

```rust
// Initializes the networking system
fn initialize_network() -> Result<NetworkSystem, NetworkError>;

// Connects to a server or another peer
fn connect_to(address: &str) -> Result<ConnectionHandle, NetworkError>;

// Sends data to a specific connection
fn send_data(handle: ConnectionHandle, data: &GameData) -> Result<(), NetworkError>;

// Receives incoming data from a connection
fn receive_data(handle: ConnectionHandle) -> Result<GameData, NetworkError>;

// Creates a game lobby
fn create_lobby(settings: &LobbySettings) -> Result<LobbyHandle, NetworkError>;

// Joins a game lobby
fn join_lobby(lobby_id: LobbyHandle) -> Result<(), NetworkError>;
```

## 4. Integration with Other Modules

The Networking module integrates with other core modules of the game engine to provide a seamless multiplayer experience:

- **Game World Management**: Synchronizes game states across the network, ensuring that all players see the same game world.
- **Input Management**: Transmits player inputs across the network, allowing for remote control of game characters and objects.
- **Scripting Engine**: Exposes networking functionalities to the scripting layer, enabling custom multiplayer logic and behaviors.
- **UI/UX System**: Manages network-related UI elements, such as connection status indicators, lobby screens, and matchmaking interfaces.

## 5. Best Practices

- **Security**: Implement encryption and secure connection protocols to protect game data and user information during transmission.
- **Efficiency**: Optimize data serialization and network protocols to minimize bandwidth usage and latency.
- **Scalability**: Design the networking system to scale with the number of players, from small peer-to-peer games to large multiplayer servers.
- **Reliability**: Include mechanisms for handling network interruptions and packet loss, ensuring a smooth player experience even under suboptimal network conditions.

## 6. Conclusion

This design document provides a comprehensive overview of the Networking module for our game engine, detailing its architecture, core components, API, and integration points. By adhering to best practices in network programming and leveraging Rust's performance and safety features, this module will enable robust and efficient multiplayer functionalities in our games.

Requirements:

- Module API: complete module API of "Networking" system  (structures, traits and methods/functions/interfaces) without implementation, that this module provides to other modules in Game Engine. Separatelly from implementation

- Implementation: I want to get submodules of "Input Management" system in separate sub-directories (each sub-module have its own directory). And each implementation part of submodule to be in separate source file. Basically following encapsulation pattern and best practices.

- Meson project
