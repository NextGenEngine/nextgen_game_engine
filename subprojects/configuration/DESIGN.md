# Engine Configuration Module

The purpose of this module would be to:

- Load and parse configuration files at the start of the engine or when needed. These configurations could dictate rendering settings (e.g., resolution, windowed/fullscreen mode), audio levels, input mappings, and other engine behavior.
- Provide a centralized interface for other modules to access their configurations. This ensures that each module, such as the Rendering Engine, Audio Engine, or Input Management, can retrieve settings relevant to their operation without directly handling file I/O or parsing logic.
- Manage dynamic changes to configurations, allowing for real-time updates to settings without restarting the engine or the game. This is particularly useful for development purposes and in-game options menus.
- Ensure compatibility and scalability by abstracting the configuration management in a way that supports different platforms and environments. This includes handling platform-specific configurations and optimizing for various hardware capabilities.

## Integration with Other Modules

While the Engine Configuration module manages the configurations, it should be designed to work closely with all other modules:

- **Rendering Engine**: Reads display and graphics settings to adjust resolution, quality, and performance.
  Audio Engine: Configures sound levels, channels, and spatialization settings.
- **Input Management**: Sets up key bindings, controller mappings, and input sensitivity.
- **Networking**: Loads network settings like port numbers, server addresses, and protocol preferences.
  Implementation Considerations
- **Flexibility**: The module should support various formats for configuration files (e.g., JSON, XML, INI) to ease the editing and reading process.
- **Security**: Ensure that the configuration system does not expose sensitive information or allow unauthorized modifications to critical settings.
- **User Interface**: Integrate with the UI/UX System module to enable in-game settings menus that interact with the Engine Configuration module for real-time updates.

## Conclusion

By separating configuration management into its own module, you maintain the modularity and clarity of your game engine architecture, making it easier to maintain, update, and extend in the future. This approach also underscores the principles of separation of concerns and single responsibility, enhancing the engine's robustness and adaptability.
