# Configuration management subsystem

**Designing a Centralized Configuration System for Your Game Engine**

---

**Overview**

You want a centralized configuration system where:

- Each component has its own configuration structure.
- Configurations are aggregated in a central configuration tree.
- Components don't know where their configuration is stored; they only know their own configuration structures.
- When configurations change, relevant components are updated automatically.
- The system is easy to extend, understand, and follows best practices.

I'll provide a complete solution that meets these requirements. The solution includes:

1. **Central Configuration Manager**: Manages the configuration tree and handles updates.
2. **Component Configuration Structures**: Each component has its own configuration structure.
3. **Registration Mechanism**: Components register their configuration paths and apply methods with the Configuration Manager.
4. **Notification Mechanism**: When a configuration changes, the Configuration Manager notifies the relevant component.
5. **Hardcoded Configuration Tree**: The configuration tree is defined explicitly, improving performance and clarity.
