# Physics Engine Design Document

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the design for the Physics Engine module of our game engine. The Physics Engine is responsible for simulating physical systems, including collision detection, rigid body dynamics, and particle systems. It is designed with performance, accuracy, and ease of integration in mind.

## 2. Architecture Overview

The Physics Engine is structured into several core components to handle different aspects of physical simulation:

- **Collision Detection**: Identifies when and where objects in the game world intersect.
- **Rigid Body Dynamics**: Simulates the movement and interaction of solid objects.
- **Soft Body Dynamics**: Manages deformable or soft objects not covered by rigid body dynamics.
- **Particle Systems**: Handles the simulation of large numbers of small particles or effects.
- **Physics World**: The overarching context that manages all physical entities and their interactions within the game environment.

### 2.1 Core Modules

#### 2.1.1 Collision Detection

- **Broad Phase**: Quickly identifies potential collisions using bounding volumes or spatial partitioning.
- **Narrow Phase**: Precisely calculates collisions between pairs of objects identified during the Broad Phase.
- **Collision Resolution**: Computes the physical response to collisions, including forces, impulses, and position corrections.

#### 2.1.2 Rigid Body Dynamics

- **Integration**: Updates the state of objects over time based on forces and torques.
- **Forces and Impulses**: Manages the application of forces and impulses to objects.
- **Constraints and Joints**: Simulates complex interactions and connections between objects, like hinges or springs.

#### 2.1.3 Soft Body Dynamics

- **Volume Preservation**: Ensures that soft bodies maintain volume under force.
- **Elasticity and Deformation**: Simulates the stretch and compression of materials.

#### 2.1.4 Particle Systems

- **Emitter Management**: Controls the creation and lifecycle of particles.
- **Particle Physics**: Simulates physical properties of particles, such as gravity and collision.

#### 2.1.5 Physics World

- **Entity Management**: Tracks all physical entities and their properties.
- **Simulation Control**: Manages the progression of the physical simulation, including stepping and pausing the simulation.

## 3. API Overview

The Physics Engine provides a Rust-based API for integration with other components of the game engine. Key aspects include:

- **Initialization and Configuration**: Functions to initialize the physics engine and configure global properties.
- **Object Management**: API for creating, modifying, and destroying physical objects.
- **Simulation Control**: Functions to start, stop, and step through the physical simulation.
- **Query Interface**: Methods for querying the physics world, including ray casting and collision checks.
- **Event Handling**: Mechanisms for receiving and responding to physics-related events.

### 3.1 Example API Functions

```rust
// Initializes the physics engine with default settings
fn initialize() -> PhysicsEngine;

// Creates a new rigid body with specified properties
fn create_rigid_body(properties: RigidBodyProperties) -> RigidBodyHandle;

// Applies a force to a rigid body
fn apply_force(handle: RigidBodyHandle, force: Vector3, point: Vector3);

// Steps the physics simulation forward by a fixed time step
fn step_simulation(delta_time: f32);

// Registers a callback for collision events
fn on_collision(callback: fn(CollisionEvent));
```

## 4. Integration with Other Modules

The Physics Engine integrates closely with several other core modules of the game engine:

- **Rendering Engine**: Provides visual representations of physical simulations.
- **Resource Management**: Manages assets related to physics simulations, such as collision meshes.
- **Game World Management**: Coordinates with the physics engine to place objects within the game world and manage their interactions.
- **Scripting Engine**: Exposes physics functionality to scripting languages for game logic customization.

## 5. Best Practices

- **Performance Optimization**: Use efficient data structures and algorithms to minimize CPU and memory usage.
- **Scalability**: Design the engine to accommodate a wide range of game scales, from small puzzles to large, open-world environments.
- **Accuracy vs. Speed Trade-offs**: Provide configurable options to balance simulation accuracy and performance according to the needs of different games.
- **Multithreading Support**: Design the engine to take advantage of multithreading, where applicable, to improve performance.
- **Extensibility**: Allow for easy extension and customization of physics behaviors and properties.

## 6. Conclusion

This design document outlines the structure and functionality of the Physics Engine module for our game engine. By following the described architecture, API, and integration strategies, and adhering to best practices, the development team can create a robust and flexible Physics Engine that meets the needs of a wide variety of games.
